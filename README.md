**Project Overview**

This project presents a comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of the *Auto.csv* dataset, a widely used benchmark dataset in automotive and statistical learning domains. The primary objective is to systematically examine the factors influencing automobile performance through a structured analytical workflow.

The analysis includes rigorous data preprocessing, univariate and multivariate statistical exploration, correlation assessment, and visualization-driven pattern discovery. Emphasis is placed on understanding the relationships between key vehicle characteristics and how these attributes collectively shape fuel economy trends.

This EDA serves as a foundation for deeper statistical modeling and machine learning tasks by identifying relevant predictors, uncovering underlying structure in the data, and highlighting potential anomalies or data quality issues. The project demonstrates a disciplined, data-driven approach to extracting meaningful insights from real-world automotive data.
